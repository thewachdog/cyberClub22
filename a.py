That's why rap needs a doctor
Our genre's lymph nodes are swole up
It's time to check it for strep or some tonsillitis
'Cause like what they swab you with when your throat hurts
That's why Tribe is so vital: we need Q-Tip for the culture
(Speed it up a little bit)
You ain't dealin' with a fuckin' featherweight
I used to medicate until I'd get a fuckin' bellyache
And now I'm finna step on the pedal, don't wanna ever brake
I want to accelerate to a level that I can elevate
Demented with the pen, I'll make the mothafucker detonate
I wanna make it acapellaâ€”wait, I gotta set a date
With the devil and celebrate, together we can renovate
And re-develop, Hell awaits, and I'ma get a special place
Now, take a ride with me, hop into my time machine
I'ma take the driver's seat as I thrust into hyperspeed
Like I'm a meteorite, and mothafuck the fucking media
Right in the behind; I'm a human encyclopedia
I must be like pie crust because I was bred to rise like I was yeast
